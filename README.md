# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple projects in **machine learning**, demonstrating **image classification, recommendation systems, and neural network modeling**. Each project is self-contained and includes code, sample datasets, and detailed documentation.

## Overview

### Image classification

- Focus: **Automatic image classification for e-commerce applications**.
- Highlights:
  - Uses the **fashion MNIST dataset** to train a neural network.
  - Performs **data preprocessing**, normalization, and model training.
  - Evaluates the model using **accuracy and loss plots**, and confusion matrices.
  - Saves and reloads trained models for further testing.
  - Optional visualization of the **neural network structure**.
  - Tools: **python**, **tensorflow/keras**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

### Recommendation system

- Focus: **Movie recommendation using user ratings**.
- Highlights:
  - Uses the **MovieLens dataset** to explore user ratings and movie metadata.
  - Computes **total votes and average ratings per movie**.
  - Filters and ranks movies to generate simple recommendations.
  - Visualizes user activity and rating distributions.
  - Tools: **python**, **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.
  - Dataset: [MovieLens Datasets](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-projects.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder of interest:

```bash
cd image_classification
```

3. Open the jupyter notebook and run the code step by step.


## Notes

- Each project is designed as a prototype for learning and experimentation.  
- Large datasets may require sufficient memory and computation resources.  
- The code is written in **python 3** and uses standard machine learning libraries.
